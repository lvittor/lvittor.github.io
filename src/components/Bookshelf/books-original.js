    //             On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues.

    //             As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. <i>In Cold Blood</i> is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.

            <p>
                In a dramatic account of violence and espionage, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Ronan Farrow exposes serial abusers and a cabal of powerful interests hellbent on covering up the truth, at any cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywoods most powerful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance that could not be explained—until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood, to Washington, and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse—and its the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, <i>Catch and Kill</i> breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power—and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook the culture.

            </p>
            <p>
                Which historic warriors conquered the most territory, killed the most people, or had the largest empire?
                When did everything evolve?
                Which languages are related to which?
                What’s been invented and when?
                Where are we being born, and what are we dying of?
                Which countries are eating all the food, causing all the pollution and taking all the drugs?
            </p>
            <p>
                A story of civilisation and barbarism, of war and peace, this is history done in a new way – a beautifully designed collection of the most insightful and revealing trends that tell us what the human race has been up to, and where we’re heading.

                As programmers, we’ve all seen source code that’s so ugly and buggy it makes our brain ache. Over the past five years, authors Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher have analyzed hundreds of examples of "bad code" (much of it their own) to determine why they’re bad and how they could be improved. Their conclusion? You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone else to understand it—even if that someone else is you.

                This book focuses on basic principles and practical techniques you can apply every time you write code. Using easy-to-digest code examples from different languages, each chapter dives into a different aspect of coding, and demonstrates how you can make your code easy to understand.

                Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> is a
                rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more
                real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's
                nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's
                attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's
                prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of
                the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell.
                Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most
                terrifying novels ever written.

                    From Eve Ensler, author of one of the most influential works of the twentieth
                    century--The Vagina Monologues--and one of Newsweek's "150 Women Who Changed the World,"
                    comes a powerful, life-changing examination of abuse and atonement.
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Like millions of women, Eve Ensler has been waiting much of her lifetime for an apology.
                Sexually and physically abused from the age of 5 by her father, Eve has struggled and
                suffered her whole life from this betrayal, longing for an honest reckoning from a man
                who is long dead. After years of work as an artist and anti-violence activist, she
                decided she was no longer waiting; an apology could be imagined, by her, for her,
                to her. This book, <i>The Apology</i>, written by Eve from her father's point of
                view in the words she longed to hear attempts to transform the abuse she suffered,
                with unflinching truthfulness, compassion, and an expansive vision for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through <i>The Apology</i> Eve has set out to provide a new way for herself and a
                possible road for others, so that survivors of abuse may finally imagine how to be
                free. In it, she grapples with questions she has sought answers to since she began
                to understand the impact of her father's abuse on her life: <i>How do we offer a
                    doorway rather than only a locked cell? How do move from humiliation to
                    revelation, from curtailing behavior to changing it, from condemning
                    perpetrators to calling them to reckoning?</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The Apology</i> is a remarkably original book that explores the deepest and
                most intimate questions that can be asked at this moment: Why do men carry out
                abuse, often against the people they know and love the most? How can we--together--stop
                it? What does it mean to apologize for these acts? What will it take for the men who
                have committed abuse to make a deep reckoning and actually apologize? As Tony Porter
                from A Call to Men says, “We've called men out, now how do we call them in?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The Apology</i> is an acutely transformational book--about how, from the wounds
                of sexual abuse, we can begin to re-emerge and heal. It is a revolutionary book
                asking everything of each of us: courage, truthfulness, and forgiveness.

            <p>
                Using unprecedented, dramatically compelling sleuthing techniques,
                legendary statistician and baseball writer Bill James applies his
                analytical acumen to crack an unsolved century-old mystery surrounding
                one of the deadliest serial killers in American history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 1898 and 1912, families across the country were bludgeoned
                in their sleep with the blunt side of an axe. Jewelry and valuables
                were left in plain sight, bodies were piled together, faces covered
                with cloth. Some of these cases, like the infamous Villasca, Iowa,
                murders, received national attention. But few people believed the
                crimes were related. And fewer still would realize that all of
                these families lived within walking distance to a train station.

            </p>
            <p>
                When celebrated baseball statistician and true crime expert Bill
                James first learned about these horrors, he began to investigate
                others that might fit the same pattern. Applying the same know-how
                he brings to his legendary baseball analysis, he empirically
                determined which crimes were committed by the same person. Then
                after sifting through thousands of local newspapers, court
                transcripts, and public records, he and his daughter Rachel
                made an astonishing discovery: they learned the true identity
                of this monstrous criminal. In turn, they uncovered one of
                the deadliest serial killers in America.
            </p>
            <p>
                Riveting and immersive, with writing as sharp as the cold side
                of an axe, <i>The Man from the Train</i> paints a vivid, psychologically
                perceptive portrait of America at the dawn of the twentieth
                century, when crime was regarded as a local problem, and
                opportunistic private detectives exploited a dysfunctional
                judicial system. James shows how these cultural factors enabled
                such an unspeakable series of crimes to occur, and his
                groundbreaking approach to true crime will convince skeptics,
                amaze aficionados, and change the way we view criminal history.

                This book draws from the entirety of human experience, quantitative and
                poetic. It teaches advanced techniques, such as visual metaphor and data
                transformations, in order to create more human presentations of data.
                It also shows how we can learn from print advertising, engineering,
                museum curation, and mythology archetypes. This human-centered approach
                works with machines to design information for people. Advance your
                understanding beyond by learning from a broad tradition of putting
                things "in formation" to create new and wonderful ways of opening
                our eyes to the world.

                In the spirit of Alvin Tofflers Future Shock,
                a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes
                to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. Whether we're buying a pair of
                jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier,
                applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401K, everyday
                decisions have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming
                abundance of choice with which we are presented.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <i>The Paradox of Choice</i>, Barry Schwartz explains why too much of a good
                thing has proven detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being.
                In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz explains how a
                culture that thrives on the availability of constantly evolving options
                can also foster profound dissatisfaction and self-blame in individuals,
                which can lead to a paralysis in decision making and, in some cases,
                depression. With the latest studies on how we make choices in our personal
                and professional lives, Schwartz offers practical advice on how to focus
                on the right choices, and how to derive greater satisfaction from choices
                that we do make.

            <p>
                An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park.
                Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint
                City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League
                coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective
                Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick
                and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and
                the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints
                and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.

                The Mustache begins with a husband's playful question to his wife:
                "What would you say if I shaved off my mustache?" But, for the hero
                of The Mustache, that simple question catapults him into a metaphysical
                nightmare as his wife and friends not only fail to notice his newly
                clean-shaven appearance but deny the existence altogether of his
                former mustache. Is he the victim of some bad joke? Or have they

                In Class Trip, little Nicolas embarks on an ill-fated overnight
                excursion. Prone to lurid imaginings of kidnappings and organ
                thefts, Nicolas watches his fantasies grow horrifyingly real
                when a local child disappears. Nicolas takes it upon himself
                to investigate, fearlessly playing detective—until he uncovers
                the devastating truth. Dramatic, taut with intensity, Carrere's
                depictions of the terrifying anxieties and shifting realities of
                modern life are marvels of concentrated emotion.

    //             go to prison. He brings us to trading desks on Wall Street, to corporate boardrooms and
    //             the offices of prosecutors and FBI agents. These revealing looks provide context for the
    //             evolution of the Justice Department’s approach to pursuing corporate criminals through
    //             the early 2000s and into the Justice Department’s approach to pursuing corporate criminals
    //             through the early 2000s and into the Justice Department of today, including the
    //             prosecutorial fiascos, corporate lobbying, trial losses, and culture shifts that have
    //             stripped the government of the will and ability to prosecute top corporate executives.

                In April of 1846, twenty-one-year-old Sarah Graves, intent on a better future, set
                 out west from Illinois with her new husband, her parents, and eight siblings.
                 Seven months later, after joining a party of emigrants led by George Donner,
                 they reached the Sierra Nevada Mountains as the first heavy snows of the season
                 closed the pass ahead of them. In early December, starving and desperate, Sarah
                 and fourteen others set out for California on snowshoes and, over the next
                 thirty-two days, endured almost unfathomable hardships and horrors.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this gripping narrative, Daniel James Brown sheds new light on one of the
                most infamous events in American history. Following every painful footstep of
                Sarah's journey with the Donner Party, Brown produces a tale both spellbinding
                and richly informative.

                OxyContin, a potent painkiller containing opium-derived oxycodone as its key
                active ingredient, was first sold in 1996 as a treatment for cancer patients
                and other chronic pain sufferers. From the start, the drug's manufacturer
                aggressively marketed its patented time-release formula as a breakthrough in
                the effort to reduce prescription drug abuse. It wasn't long, however, before
                thrill-seeking teenagers shattered that illusion of safety; by simply crushing
                an "Oxy," they were able to tap into a high so seductive it would come to
                dominate their lives. Some patients, seeking relief from pain, also found
                themselves drawn to the drug's dark side.

                <i>Pain Killer</i> takes readers on a journey of discovery that begins with the true
                story of Lindsay, a high-school cheerleader in Virginia who gets hooked on Oxys,
                and expands outward to explore the critical issues of legitimate pain management,
                prescription drug abuse, and how the misuse of science by the drug industry
                threatens the public good. With the fast-rising abuse of prescription drugs by
                young people ringing alarm bells within government, the how and why behind the
                OxyContin disaster is a gripping read not only for parents, but also for medical
                professionals, community leaders, business executives, and all those concerned
                with this crisis.

                The startups that Google Ventures invest in face big questions every day:
                Where’s the most important place to focus your effort, and how do you start?
                What will your ideas look like in real life? How many meetings and discussions
                does it take before you can be sure you have the right solution to a problem?
                Business owners and investors want their companies and the people who lead
                them to be equipped to answer these questions—and quickly. And now there’s
                a sure-fire way to solve their problems and test solutions: the sprint.

                While working at Google, designer Jake Knapp created a unique problem-solving
                method that he coined a “design sprint”—a five-day process to help companies
                answer crucial questions. His ‘sprints’ were used on everything from Google
                Search to Chrome to Google X. When he moved to Google Ventures, he joined
                Braden Kowitz and John Zeratsky, both designers and partners there who worked
                on products like YouTube and Gmail. Together Knapp, Zeratsky, and Kowitz have
                run over 100 sprints with their portfolio companies. They’ve seen firsthand
                how sprints can overcome challenges in all kinds of companies: healthcare,
                fitness, finance, retailers, and more.

                It’s for anyone with a big opportunity, problem, or idea who needs to get

                A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive
                serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a
                decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically
                while investigating the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>"You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed
                fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south,
                where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared,
                eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives
                in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who
                created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to
                find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer."
                Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded
                herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case
                as she was.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the
                ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of
                vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he
                favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was
                there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while
                they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they
                could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural
                whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>I’ll Be Gone in the Dark</i>—the masterpiece McNamara was writing
                at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a
                moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind
                and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s
                obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction
                by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book
                was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague.
                Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime
                classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.

                Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age
                five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication
                problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her
                classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the
                teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world.
                For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered
                parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare
                of a school principal, Miss ("The") Trunchbull, a former
                hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and
                is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately
                for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such
                annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and
                an innate predilection for revenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents,
                but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher,
                the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is
                never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this
                wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping
                the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional
                truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her

                From the Emmy, PEN, Peabody, Critics' Choice, and Golden Globe
                Award-winning creator of the TV show Fargo comes the thriller
                of the year.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a foggy summer night, 11 people - 10 privileged, one down-on-his-luck
                painter - depart Martha's Vineyard on a private jet headed for New
                York. Sixteen minutes later the unthinkable happens: The plane plunges
                into the ocean. The only survivors are Scott Burroughs - the painter -
                and a four-year-old boy who is now the last remaining member of an
                immensely wealthy and powerful media mogul's family.
            </p>
            <p>
                With chapters weaving between the aftermath of the crash and the
                backstories of the passengers and crew members - including a Wall
                Street titan and his wife, a Texan-born party boy just in from
                London, a young woman questioning her path in life, and a career
                pilot - the mystery surrounding the tragedy heightens. As the
                passengers' intrigues unravel, odd coincidences point to a
                conspiracy. Was it merely by dumb chance that so many influential
                people perished? Or was something far more sinister at work?
                Events soon threaten to spiral out of control in an escalating
                storm of media outrage and accusations. And while Scott struggles
                to cope with fame that borders on notoriety, the authorities
                scramble to salvage the truth from the wreckage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amid pulse-quickening suspense, the fragile relationship between
                Scott and the young boy glows at the heart of this stunning novel,
                raising questions of fate, human nature, and the inextricable ties
                that bind us together.

                Four hundred years from now mankind is strung out across a region of
                interstellar space inherited from an ancient civilization discovered
                on Mars. The colonies are linked together by the occasional sublight
                colony ship voyages and hyperspatial data-casting. Human consciousness
                is digitally freighted between the stars and downloaded into bodies as
                a matter of course.

                But some things never change. So when ex-envoy, now-convict Takeshi
                Kovacs has his consciousness and skills downloaded into the body of
                a nicotine-addicted ex-thug and presented with a catch-22 offer, he
                really shouldn't be surprised. Contracted by a billionaire to discover
                who murdered his last body, Kovacs is drawn into a terrifying conspiracy
                that stretches across known space and to the very top of society.
